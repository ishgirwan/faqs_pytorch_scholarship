# Few details about the course contents and upcoming activities

**Q1: Is there any colab projects are there for the challenge near future?**
-   There will be an opportunity for collaboration in our project showcase that will happen towards the end of Phase 1. In the meantime, you can colab on ideas to enrich this community whether that be host an AMA, a live webinar - pitch us your best ideas!

**Q2: Just wondering if it does it matter if we log into the course regularly (in the sense of a certain number of times per week) for moving onto phase 2? Due to other commitments, many people will not be able to do this. I know you want to see steady progress but is it OK if it's once every other week or so?**
-   All that matters is that your coursework and the final Challenge project is completed by the January 9th deadline.  While steady progress is recommended so you don't find yourself in pickle as the deadline draws near, we understand everyone has busy schedules. As was said previously - while it's not mandatory to devote huge chunks at a time to either your coursework or your community involvement even if you're able to devote 15-20 min here and there we see that and appreciate it as every little bit helps!

**Q3: Can I access course Material After January?**
-   After the deadline passes you'll retain static access to the coursework - meaning it will be viewable but you will not be able to resubmit the last Challenge project. 

**Q4: What are some other student leader opportunities coming in December?**
-   There is a [Tandem program](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/community?authuser=0#h.p_k7Juqt2topbl) is coming soon! 

**Q5: Are there any recommended timeline where people are expected to be at what time so as to monitor our progress?**
- There are no specific deadlines, other than the final deadline of Jan 9, 2019. People are suggested to go at their own pace, and working a few hours evryday is better than cramping all the content in one week.

**Q6:  Concerning slack workspace, is there in the a near future a plan to upgrade into "Standard plan" for Udacity slack?**
-   Unfortunately, we will not be moving this workspace to a paid plan.

**Q7: How much does active participation here count on one getting the nanodegree?** 
- Unfortunately, we can not disclose the exact weight that it has. But it matters a lot. Besides, think of it this way: if you explain what you are learning, you know it better too. So you are helping us and learning more as well, and making connections and friends. It is heaven on earth, or close to it :grinning: It is a win-win situation.
