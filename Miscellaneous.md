# Diiferent inquiries surrounding the course

**Q1: When we have an announcement, it shows a `1` written aside the channel name. But I, for some announcements, don't see that. So, I miss some announcements when they are posted.**
-   Slack workspace is being picky with regards to those notifications! To make sure you don't miss any, I would periodically check our [PyTorch Challenge site](https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/pytorch-scholarship-facebook/announcements)

**Q2: Is participating in a study group make any impact to get selected in phase 2 apart from other requirements?**
-   Participating in a given study group is not a requirement. What matters is overall participation in the Slack community.

**Q3: How do we contact the student leader in our channels? Do we have a list?**
-   You can have all the SL [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eTaHfnZ6nCXKsC5m5iLsejfV8IwfE0NgD2uhzH_Azws/edit?usp=sharing).

**Q4: Can you share about your success journey with Udacity? Is there any future opportunity to get chance work with Facebook? In this challenge would we have surprises? Can we be authorized to organized events that expand our knowledge and skills?**
-   We do have things planned and we promise to share when the time comes! You are definitely encouraged to organize events - if you do, please post them to our private Facebook group so others can participate!

**Q5:Is there any chance that the top 300 cap (selection) will be increased to higher number?**
-   Unfortunately no. Everything is already set up with Facebook who is giving the scholarships and it is unlikely that the number will be changed.

**Q6: what would one consider as a  "deep impact" or good result from a channel or study group, of course after that all members finish their course.**
-   Definitely that everyone in the Study Group completes the Challenge first and foremost! An cherry on top would be if the group was also able to create a project that showcased what was learned from the Challenge material. Although the last is completely not mandatory or necessary!

**Q7: Are there any relevant job opportunities for those best 300 from phase 1?**
-   Udacity provide carrier services which makes you prepare for the right job and certificate enhance your skills to make your chances blow into opportunities.
-   A Deep Learning Nanodegree will truly provide you with the skills you need. In the meantime, here is the link to [Udacity's Career Resources Center](https://career-resource-center.udacity.com/) to help prepare you when you are ready to start your job search.

**Q8: About our side or group projects, how do you suggest publishing and sharing them? Maybe in a blog and then repost it to the Facebook group or directly in facebook album?**
-   We share the details once we announce the program. In the meantime, sharing here in Slack in the new #side-projects channel and in a blog is a fantastic idea - especially as the facebook group is private.

**Q9: Do student leaders need to submit any reports?**
-   No formal reports are required but please do check in by attending the weekly SL meetings if you can which are helld in the private SL channel.

**Q10: Are there any plans about discounts for students who will not be in top 300?**
- The updates will be shared after the results are out, meanwhile, keep working hard. All of us have an equal chance of still being in top 300 ;)

**Q11: How did you select the top 10,000 scholar recipient, did you use an AI or machine learning?**
-   We factor in many things. However, like any other University we do not share the selection process.  Everyone here should feel proud to have been selected!

**Q12: Since you are unable to update your application essay. Will the Facebook story album and story be considered part of selection process?**
-   Keep in mind that this experience, this program is all about growth and learning. Hearing your student story is what really drives home - for Udacity as well as Facebook - that this Scholarship opportunity is something we need to do more of. We hope that you will submit your story to us.

**Q13: Do student leaders have more chance of getting selected for the nanodegree?**
-   Being a Student Leader doesn't guarantee anything. You still need to participate, put in the work and make sure that your model is good enough.
